# Payloads

This repository hosts payload files via GitHub Pages as a **project site**.

## Accessing the Files

The payload.js file is hosted at: `https://cyb3r7hr347.github.io/payloads/payload.js`

Visit the main page at: `https://cyb3r7hr347.github.io/payloads/`

## GitHub Pages Setup

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages. The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch.

### Coexistence with Other Sites

This is a **project site** that deploys to `https://cyb3r7hr347.github.io/payloads/`. It does NOT conflict with:
- Your main user/organization site at `https://cyb3r7hr347.github.io/`
- Other project sites at `https://cyb3r7hr347.github.io/other-repo/`

GitHub allows one user/organization site and unlimited project sites, so both can coexist without any issues.
